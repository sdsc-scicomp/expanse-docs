# Composable Systems

Expanse also supports Composable Systems, allowing researchers to create a virtual 'tool set' of resources, such as Kubernetes resources, for a specific project and then re-compose it as needed. Expanse will also feature direct scheduler integration with the major cloud providers, leveraging high-speed networks to ease data movement to and from the cloud.

All Composable System requests must include a brief justification, specifically describing why a Composable System is required for the project.
